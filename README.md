# Projects

There are 4 working projects at the moment:
- Blockchain Product Creator. (can be found at ".\Blockchain_Development\Projects") <br>
- ChattyBot (can be found at ".\ChattyBot")<br>
- Minewalker (can be found at ".\Minewalker").<br>
- Traffic Simulator (can be found at ".\TrafficSimulator").<br>
- Spell.py (can be found at ".\SpellGame").<br></br>

## Blockchain Product Creator
This is an application completed with the aid of a project tutorial, in addition to my own
enhancements, that deploys a smart contract on the blockchain. This program:<br>
a. Creates products, characterised by a price and name;<br>
b. Gives a unique wallet address to pay for the products; and<br>
c. Informs the user when the product has been paid, via MetaMask or otherwise.<br>
This kind of program can be used, say, between a business, who creates a product with its price to
generate a secure wallet address, and a client, who will pay the appropriate amount of ETH to that
wallet address using Metamask. If the smart contract deems the transaction to be successful, an event
can be triggered, like delivery.
Here is a link to a video demonstration of the smart contract application:<br>

## AI Chatbot 
I have a project on an Artificially Intelligent Chatbot based on a package called Rasa. This program uses Natural Language Understanding to interpret the user’s message and APIs to retrieve live data for responses. The user can type phrases into the GUI interface to get:<br>
- the time in most cities;<br>
- the weather in most cities;<br>
- general information on any country;<br>
- a definition and example for most words;<br>
- the latest COVID data in most countries;<br>
- a joke;<br>
- a trivia question;<br>
- music metadata when the link to an artist is pasted; and<br>
- a song played on Spotify in the browser.<br>

The conversation displayed can be exported, or cleared, and the program can read out its responses to the user. There are 6 categories and 6 blacklist options the user can choose to be included in the Chatbot’s jokes in the “Settings” tab. The program may speak its responses to the user when the “voice” button is toggled on. Voice settings can also be altered in settings, including the rate, volume and gender of the text-to-speech module.<br></br>

## Traffic Simulator
This is a simple JavaScript traffic simulator of vehicles interacting on a roundabout. Their interactions can be influenced with the provided sliders, changing the:<br>
- Speed Limit<br>
- Car Density<br>
- Critical Gap<br>
- Aggression (high aggression causes cars to honk more)<br>

There are also graphs that display the data of the cars’ density, traffic flow, and flow velocity.<br></br>

## Audio Spelling Game
This Python program is an audio-based spelling game that prompts the user to spell words of increasing difficulty. It can calculate the “correctness” of each spelled word as a percentage, by comparing the letters of the spelt word and their position with those of the correctly spelt word.<br></br>

## Minewalker
This is a terminal-based game where the objective is for the user to cross a field of mines. The user can customise the game, including the symbols and colours used, the size of the field, the number of mines, and the difficulty of the level. The player also has the ability to check if tiles within a 1-tile radius are safe a certain number of times by pressing the spacebar.<br></br>

There are other smaller programs that can be found in ".\Smaller_programs"
