# Projects

There are 2 working programs at the moment:
  - Minewalker.py (terminal-based game where the user walks across a field of mines)
    Note: Minewalker.py will create a local file called "High_Scores.txt" when the player's score is saved.

  - Main.html (A basic traffic simulator)

Spell.py works, but has an issue with the naming of some of its files.
There are other smaller programs in the "Smaller_programs" file
