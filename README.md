# Projects

There are 3 working projects at the moment:
  - Minewalker.py (terminal-based game where the user walks across a field of mines)
    Note: Minewalker.py will create a local file called "High_Scores.txt" when the player's score is saved.

  - Main.html (A basic traffic simulator)
  - Spell.py (An audio-based spelling game)

If Spell.py doesn't work, you might need to create a virtual environment and install the dependencies listed at the start of the program or add pywin32 to PATH.
There are other smaller programs in the "Smaller_programs" file
