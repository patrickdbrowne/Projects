- Spell.py (can be found at ".\SpellGame"An audio-based spelling game).<br><\br>

ChattyBot is under construction...
If Spell.py doesn't work, you might need to create a virtual environment and install the dependencies listed at the start of the program or add pywin32 to PATH.
There are other smaller programs in the "Smaller_programs" file
