1. open two cmd terminals
2. go to "ChattyBot" directory in both
3. type "conda activate env" in both
4. in one, type "rasa run actions" for the server actions (runs python code)
5. in the other, type "rasa shell"
6. once you've finished, close the shells and type "conda deactivate"

If rasa shell doesn't work, there's probably a typo or something of the likes in domain.

Before running main.py for Tkinter:
- "Rasa run actions"
- "Rasa run --enable-api"
- main.py


===========NEW-VERSION==============
Create a virtual environment with all the requirements
run "main.py" in the virtual environnment in the "ChattyBot" directory
